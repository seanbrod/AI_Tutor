Vegetarian Diets: Planetary Health and Its

ABSTRACT

To maintain planetary health, human activities must limit the use of Earth's resources within finite boundaries and avoid environmental degradation.
At present, food systems account fora substantial use of natural resources and contribute considerably to climate change, degradation of land, water
use, and other impacts, which in turn threaten human health through food insecurity. Additionally, current dietary patterns, rich in animal products
and excessive in calories, are detrimental to both population and planetary health. In order to resolve the diet-environment-health trilemma,
population-level dietary changes are essential. Vegetarian diets are reported to be healthy options. Most plant-sourced foods are less resource
intense and taxing on the environment than the production of animal-derived foods, particularly meat and dairy from ruminants. This review article
explores simultaneously the environmental sustainability of vegetarian diets, and its alignment with people's health. In general, the progression from
omnivorous to ovolactovegetarian and vegan diets is associated with increased environmental sustainability. Greenhouse gas emissions resulting
from vegan and ovolactovegetarian diets are ~50% and ~35% lower, respectively, than most current omnivore diets, and with corresponding
reductions in the use of natural resources. Concomitant health benefits could be obtained by shifting from current dietary patterns to sustainable
vegetarian diets. Thus, there seems to be an alignment of health and environmental outcomes for vegetarian diets. Although this shows the human
health and environmental sustainability benefits of vegetarian diets in high-income countries, questions remain about the challenges in other
contexts and the political will to promote meat-free diets as the social norm. Adv Nutr 2019;10:S380-S388.
