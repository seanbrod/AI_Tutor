Correction

Errors in Figures. In the Original Investigation by
Chakravarty et al titled “Reduced Disability and Mor-
tality Among Aging Runners: A 21-Year Longitudinal
Study,” published in the August 11/25, 2008, issue of the
Archives (2008;168[15]:1638-1646), an error occurred
in the Figure 2 legend on page 1642. The corrected leg-
end reads as follows: “Figure 2. Mean disability levels
by year separated by sex. Solid lines represent data for
male participants, and dashed lines represent data for fe-
male participants who continued participation through
2005. Only subjects who completed the 21-year fol-
low-up are included. Error bars indicate SD.”

An error also occurred in Figure 1B on page 1641.
In the key, the dark dashed line should read “Never run-
ners (completers, n=83)” and the light dashed line should
read “Ever runners (completers, n=357).”
