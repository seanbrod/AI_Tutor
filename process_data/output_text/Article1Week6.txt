behaviour. Overall, 18.5% of the respondents reported sitting >7.5 h/day. Occupation was the primary discrimi-
nator. The subgroup most likely to engage in extensive sitting were higher educated, had white-collar jobs, re-
ported no difficulties with paying bills, and used the internet frequently. Clear socio-demographic profiles
were identified for adults across Europe who engage in extended sedentary time. Furthermore, physically active
participants were consistently less likely to engage in longer daily sitting times. In general, those with more in-
dicators of higher wealth were more likely to spend more time sitting.
