ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT
Keywords: Until recently, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has been overlooked as a potential modifier of
Cardiorespiratory fitness the inverse association between obesity and mortality (the so-called obesity paradox),
Obesity paradox observed in patients with known or suspected cardiovascular (CV) disease. Evidence from
Coronary heart disease five observational cohort studies of 30,104 patients (87% male) with CV disease indicates
that CRF significantly alters the obesity paradox. There is general agreement across studies
that the obesity paradox persists among patients with low CRF, regardless of whether
adiposity is assessed by body mass index, waist circumference, or percentage body fat.
However, among patients with high CRF, risk of all-cause mortality is lowest for the
overweight category in some, but not all, studies, suggesting that higher levels of fitness
may modify the relationship between body fatness and survival in patients manifesting an
obesity paradox. Further study is needed to better characterize the joint contribution of CRF
and obesity on mortality in diverse populations.
