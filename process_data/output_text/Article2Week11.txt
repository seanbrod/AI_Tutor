Accepted 15 January 2021 Objective The objective of this study was to examine the association of frequency of
eating meals prepared away from home with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

index, the hazard ratio of mortality among participants who ate meals prepared away
from home very frequently (2 meals or more per day) compared with those who seldom
ate meals prepared away from home (fewer than 1 meal/wk) was 1.49 (95% CI 1.05 to
2.13) for all-cause mortality, 1.18 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.55) for cardiovascular mortality, and
1.67 (95% CI 0.87 to 3.21) for cancer mortality.
Conclusions Frequent consumption of meals prepared away from home is significantly
associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. The association of eating meals
prepared away from home with cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality warrants
additional investigation.

THE ART OF DIETETICS _ _
As a student | have heard a number of opinions on what area is the most important in order to achieve proper nutrition. What | feel is most
important is family meals. Moderation is key, but socializing over a meal encourages positive mental health and healthy eating patterns. This
is a picture of the people | love. My health is a reflection of my diet and they give me a reason to cherish it.

value in exploring the potential benefits of exercise strategies that involve reduced time com-
mitment. Large-scale randomized clinical trials are needed to advance the field.
