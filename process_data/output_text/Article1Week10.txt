Study Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of a 12-week exercise training program for reducing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity and im- g
proving sleep quality, and to explore possible mechanisms by which exercise may reduce OSA severity. a
Design: Randomized controlled trial. 2.
Setting: Clinical exercise physiology center, sleep laboratory. s
Participants: Forty-three sedentary and overweight/obese adults aged 18-55 years with at least moderate-severity untreated OSA (screening =
apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] 2 15). 8
Interventions: Participants randomized to exercise training (n = 27) met 4 times/week for 12 weeks and performed 150 min/week of moderate- a
intensity aerobic activity, followed by resistance training twice/week. Participants randomized to a stretching control (n = 16) met twice weekly for ied
12 weeks to perform low-intensity exercises designed to increase whole-body flexibility. 2
Measurements and Results: OSA severity was assessed with one night of laboratory polysomnography (PSG) before and following the 12-week 8
intervention. Measures of sleep quality included PSG, actigraphy (7-10 days), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Compared with stretching, ES
exercise resulted in a significant AHI reduction (exercise: 32.2 + 5.6 to 24.6 + 4.4, stretching: 24.4 + 5.6 to 28.9 + 6.4; P < 0.01) as well as signifi- 2
cant changes in oxygen desaturation index (ODI; P = 0.03) and stage N3 sleep (P = 0.03). Reductions in AHI and ODI were achieved without a =
significant decrease in body weight. Improvements in actigraphic sleep and subjective sleep quality were also noted following exercise compared =
with stretching. g
Conclusions: Exercise training had moderate treatment efficacy for the reduction of AHI in sedentary overweight/obese adults, which suggests &
that exercise may be beneficial for the management of OSA beyond simply facilitating weight loss. &

Functional status was operationally defined for 3 levels: (1) activities of daily living (ADLs) dependence is defined as report of needing help from another person or being unable to perform
any of 6 basic ADLs, 2) Instrumental ADL difficulty is defined as report of no ADL dependence but difficulty performing shopping, meal preparation, or heavy housework, and (3) In-
dependent is defined as no report of ADL dependence or instrumental ADL difficulty.

bValue is the pooled estimate of the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for age, sex, and gait speed for the studies that were used in the comparisons of gait speed with
use of mobility aids and functional status. Four studies were included in the estimates of 5 y mortality and three in the estimates of 10 y mortality. Values are reported as the C statistic
representing area under the receiver operator characteristic curve; values that differ by 0.025 or more are considered substantially different.”

C statistic is greater than for age and sex alone.

dC statistic is greater than for age, sex, and diseases.
