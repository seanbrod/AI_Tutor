Study Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of a 12-week exercise training program for reducing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity and im- g
proving sleep quality, and to explore possible mechanisms by which exercise may reduce OSA severity. a
Design: Randomized controlled trial. 2.
Setting: Clinical exercise physiology center, sleep laboratory. s
Participants: Forty-three sedentary and overweight/obese adults aged 18-55 years with at least moderate-severity untreated OSA (screening =
apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] 2 15). 8
Interventions: Participants randomized to exercise training (n = 27) met 4 times/week for 12 weeks and performed 150 min/week of moderate- a
intensity aerobic activity, followed by resistance training twice/week. Participants randomized to a stretching control (n = 16) met twice weekly for ied
12 weeks to perform low-intensity exercises designed to increase whole-body flexibility. 2
Measurements and Results: OSA severity was assessed with one night of laboratory polysomnography (PSG) before and following the 12-week 8
intervention. Measures of sleep quality included PSG, actigraphy (7-10 days), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Compared with stretching, ES
exercise resulted in a significant AHI reduction (exercise: 32.2 + 5.6 to 24.6 + 4.4, stretching: 24.4 + 5.6 to 28.9 + 6.4; P < 0.01) as well as signifi- 2
cant changes in oxygen desaturation index (ODI; P = 0.03) and stage N3 sleep (P = 0.03). Reductions in AHI and ODI were achieved without a =
significant decrease in body weight. Improvements in actigraphic sleep and subjective sleep quality were also noted following exercise compared =
with stretching. g
Conclusions: Exercise training had moderate treatment efficacy for the reduction of AHI in sedentary overweight/obese adults, which suggests &
that exercise may be beneficial for the management of OSA beyond simply facilitating weight loss. &

ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT
Keywords: Until recently, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has been overlooked as a potential modifier of
Cardiorespiratory fitness the inverse association between obesity and mortality (the so-called obesity paradox),
Obesity paradox observed in patients with known or suspected cardiovascular (CV) disease. Evidence from
Coronary heart disease five observational cohort studies of 30,104 patients (87% male) with CV disease indicates
that CRF significantly alters the obesity paradox. There is general agreement across studies
that the obesity paradox persists among patients with low CRF, regardless of whether
adiposity is assessed by body mass index, waist circumference, or percentage body fat.
However, among patients with high CRF, risk of all-cause mortality is lowest for the
overweight category in some, but not all, studies, suggesting that higher levels of fitness
may modify the relationship between body fatness and survival in patients manifesting an
obesity paradox. Further study is needed to better characterize the joint contribution of CRF
and obesity on mortality in diverse populations.
