 Hi class and welcome back to Food is Function and Movement is Medicine. The topic of today's discussion is sleep. As you will learn, sleep is crucial to allowing your body to recover and maintain homeostasis. So let's discuss how to maximize your sleep for better performance. Carmen, how important is sleep to you? And do you have any ways that you like to measure your sleep or ensure that you are well rested for the next day? Why yes, yes I do. A good night's sleep is imperative to living a healthy lifestyle and should be considered as another pillar of lifestyle medicine. Sleep allows your body to recover and heal from the day. Appropriate sleep sharpens your mind and allows your body to physically perform to its maximum ability. I really like new technologies like the Aura, the Whoop, Apple Watches and other fitness devices that can be used to monitor your sleep by tracking total hours, sleep interruptions and sleep quality. These tools are a new and welcome way to support good sleep practices. It is really convenient how technology can help us learn about our individual sleep habits that we would not otherwise be able to track. Yet screen time from our technological devices close to bedtime is one of the main barriers to quality and sufficient sleep. The blue light emitted from the devices interferes with the melatonin surge we need to fall asleep naturally. This topic is another example of how technology can be both harmful and also something we can leverage for our health. Paying attention to your sleep and being well rested can improve health drastically. I would encourage everyone to start tracking their sleep. If you have the technology available, use that or just simply do the old fashioned way. Start a journal. Write down when you go to bed and when you wake up. Also be sure to rate your energy level that day on a scale of one to ten. You can learn a lot about yourself, your mood, your performance, your own personal health when you take the time to review your sleep habits over time. Thanks Carmen. I agree. Stay tuned to this week's lecture videos to learn more about the effects of sleep or lack of sleep on your health and performance.
