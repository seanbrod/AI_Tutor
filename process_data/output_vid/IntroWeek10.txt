 Hi everyone, and welcome back to class. This video we will talk about habits including how to form them and why we should make an effort to make a habit out of our healthy lifestyles. Start by thinking about what habits you may have accrued as a part of your daily life. Maybe you're considering your morning routine like brushing your teeth or showering. These habits take little effort and we do them so much that we don't even think of them as habits. Now think about a different type of habit that may take more effort. This could include your study habits for example. Maybe you're studying best by making flashcards, studying with friends, or studying in a certain location. These are all habits that take effort but ensure that you can prepare for your exams to the best of your ability. This week we're going to discuss how to create exercise and diet habits that will make eating healthy and getting physical activity part of your daily routine. On average it takes about two months to develop a habit. So these lifestyle changes may take some time and effort to fully develop. It's not so much that you're going to be super fit or even the most super nutritious at the end of two months. The major change that occurs in these two months is in your brain. You have become better at exercising and or choosing nutritious foods as a result of rewiring your brain. Behavior change is hard and it takes time. However once you get started you will be surprised how quickly you can fall into a new routine. Before you watch the lectures for this week think of some ways you can incorporate healthy eating and exercise into your daily routine. Be sure to watch the videos this week to learn how to sustain these routines.
