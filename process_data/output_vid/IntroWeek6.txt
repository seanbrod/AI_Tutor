 Hello everyone and welcome back to class where we examine food as function and movement as medicine. This week's lesson is all about medical costs. We will examine the statistics behind medical bills in the United States. We will examine the importance of staying healthy through powerful lifestyle medicines so you can avoid high doctor bills that come as a result of a sedentary lifestyle. As many of you may be aware, medical bills can get extremely expensive and have a huge impact on your financial wellness and budgeting. But just how expensive are we talking about Julie? 4.5 trillion dollars expensive Carmen. That's right in 2022 the US accumulated about 4.5 trillion dollars in total medical expenses which is way higher than any other country in the world today. That's thirteen thousand four hundred ninety three dollars per person which is more than double the average of other wealthy nations. This was a 4.1 percent increase from the previous year and accounted for about seventeen percent of our country's gross domestic product. Wow that is really expensive. Of course we know some medical expenses are from unavoidable conditions or injuries but let us recognize that a huge percentage of these costs are mostly related to preventable illnesses and disease. Make sure you watch the lectures this week to learn how proper nutrition and exercise can help minimize health care costs by preventing chronic conditions. We'll also talk about how to save money on food while eating more according to the dietary guidelines for Americans. you
