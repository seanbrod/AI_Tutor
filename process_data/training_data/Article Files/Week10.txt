Functional status was operationally defined for 3 levels: (1) activities of daily living (ADLs) dependence is defined as report of needing help from another person or being unable to perform
any of 6 basic ADLs, 2) Instrumental ADL difficulty is defined as report of no ADL dependence but difficulty performing shopping, meal preparation, or heavy housework, and (3) In-
dependent is defined as no report of ADL dependence or instrumental ADL difficulty.

bValue is the pooled estimate of the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for age, sex, and gait speed for the studies that were used in the comparisons of gait speed with
use of mobility aids and functional status. Four studies were included in the estimates of 5 y mortality and three in the estimates of 10 y mortality. Values are reported as the C statistic
representing area under the receiver operator characteristic curve; values that differ by 0.025 or more are considered substantially different.�

C statistic is greater than for age and sex alone.

dC statistic is greater than for age, sex, and diseases.
